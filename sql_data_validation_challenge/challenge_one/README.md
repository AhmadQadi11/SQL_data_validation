 Challenge One: Customer Data Validation

 Can this table be signed off and shared with stakeholders?

No, this table should not be shared with stakeholders in its current state** for the following reasons:

1. Data Completeness Issues: 
   - Missing critical contact information (email, phone) in multiple records
   - Missing demographic information (birthdate)

2. Data Accuracy Issues:
   - Duplicate phone numbers across multiple customers suggest data entry errors
   - Invalid email format would prevent stakeholder communication

3. Data Consistency Issues:
   - Inconsistent date formats
   - Potential duplicate customer records
